I am a long time Java programmer with some Clojure experience in functional programming. Can you recommend any reading to learn to program web applications in Kotlin?

Yes, absolutely! If you're already familiar with Java and Clojure, learning to program web applications in Kotlin should be relatively straightforward. Here are a few resources you might find helpful:

The official Kotlin website (https://kotlinlang.org/) is a great place to start. It includes a wealth of information about the language, including tutorials, documentation, and a user guide.

- The "Kotlin in Action" book (https://www.manning.com/books/kotlin-in-action) is another great resource for learning Kotlin. Written by experienced Kotlin developers, it covers the language in depth and includes lots of examples and exercises to help you learn the ins and outs of the language.
- If you prefer to learn by watching videos, the Kotlin channel on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCA0ZcqzunKjfLQ-7wUJb6UQ) is a great place to start. It includes a wide range of videos on different aspects of Kotlin, including tutorials, talks, and interviews with experienced Kotlin developers.

Overall, there are many great resources available for learning to program web applications in Kotlin. The key is to find the ones that work best for you and your learning style, and to practice, practice, practice! Good luck!
